# AI Face Mask & Safety Helmet Detection System

AI-based safety compliance monitoring system using YOLOv8 and OpenCV.

IMPORTANT:
Default YOLOv8 COCO model does NOT include mask or helmet classes.
For real implementation, use a custom-trained mask/helmet YOLO model.

## Features
- Real-time person detection (placeholder)
- Image capture and logging
- Webcam or video input support

## Setup

1. Install Python 3.10+
2. Install dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Run:
   python main.py

Replace model weights with trained mask/helmet model for accurate detection.
